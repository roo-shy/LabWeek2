## LabWeek2 - HTML Report from CSV

Learning Objectives

* Understand data design
* Deeply understand ruby styles, variables, and loops

 This goal of this assignment is to answer a few questions for Hermes.

* How much money did we make this week?

* How much of a bonus did each employee get? (bonuses are paid to employees who pilot the Planet Express)

* How many trips did each employee pilot?

Different employees have favorite destinations they always pilot to

* Fry - pilots to Earth (because he isn't allowed into space)

* Amy - pilots to Mars (so she can visit her family)

* Bender - pilots to Uranus (teeheee...)

* Leela - pilots everywhere else because she is the only responsible one

They get a bonus of 10% of the money for the shipment as the bonus

Sections on the HTML with:

* h1 with the total money we made this week

* List of all Shipments (create a table with the shipments listed)

* List of all employees and their number of trips and bonus

* Pie chart of the Money each employee delivered
